Battleship game

By Cole Hersh, Rachel Benincasa, Bronson Housmans, and Emma Elliott

Requrirements: 

Java: https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp
I use 22.0.1 2024-04-16, but later versions should work.  Earlier versions up to a certain point (not sure when) will give issues

JavaFx SDK 12.0.1 (not sure if newer verisons will work) - install at :https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

to run the game from IDE: add VM arg : --module-path "<insert path>\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.media

to run from Jar: java --module-path "\<insert path>\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.media -jar battleship.jar 

For the exe, I do not know if that will work as I have not had the opprotunity to use it on other machines.  If anyone knows a better way to make an EXE with libaries inlcuded let me know

NOTE: the More Info button on the main menu does not work
